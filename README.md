In the present era one of the greatest problems faced by the world is water scarcity. Optimal use of water is the need of the hour. Agriculture, being a demanding occupation consumes plenty of water. Therefore, a system is required that uses water judiciously.

Smart Farm system estimates and measures diminution of existing plant moisture in order to operate an irrigation system, restoring water as needed while minimizing excess water use.

The system consists of four components:
Soil Moisture Sensor: to measure the amount moisture present in the soil
Ultrasonic Sensor: placed on top of the water tank which measures the level of water present in the water tank
DHT11 Sensor: used to sense the temperature of the field
Artificial Lighting using light sensor: provides light to the field if the amount of light is less as is the case during cloudy or rainy days

The data is collected from the soil moisture sensor and ultrasonic sensor is sent to the cloud through Thingspeak and are plotted as graphs.
